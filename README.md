# scrimba-7-day-css-challenge
Welcome to the 7-day _CSS_ challenge! 

As seen on the Scrimba mini-course.

"Welcome to the 7-day CSS challenge!

Every day for the next week, you'll get a CSS challenge right here in your inbox. The challenges have been created by Jad Khalili and will be presented as Scrimba screencasts, meaning you can solve them directly in the browser. The following day, you'll get Jad's suggested solution, along with the next challenge.

### Day 1: Improve this site

In this challenge, you'll get a basic HTML skeleton along with a design you're going implement. It's pretty simple, as we want to start off easy, and then ramp up the level throughout the week.

If you manage to solve the challenge, feel free to share your solution in the #share-your-code channel in our community Discord. However, there is no need to reply to this email with your solution, as I don't have time to look at all of the solutions our students create."
